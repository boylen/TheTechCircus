        <p><strong>This category covers the costly, resource-draining, or outright pointless government actions driven by impulsive, legally dubious, or unworkable Trump directives—especially those that burn through public funds, staff time, and political capital, but result in little or nothing of value.</strong></p>
        <p>These are the headline-grabbing "brain farts" that get implemented (sometimes at great expense) before being reversed, abandoned, or exposed as unworkable, unconstitutional, or just plain silly. Below, you'll find the worst offenders—colorfully labeled for your reading pleasure—with a "See More" button for the gory details and receipts.</p>

      <h3 class="disclaimer-title">A Mere Sampling of the Full Catastrophe</h3>
      <p class="disclaimer-text">What you're witnessing above is but a <em>tiny morsel</em> from the grand buffet of blunders. Public sources document <strong>tens of thousands</strong> of false or misleading statements and <strong>hundreds</strong> of failures, scandals, and controversial actions by Trump.</p>
      
      <div class="hover-reveal">
        <span class="reveal-trigger">Care for the shocking numbers?</span>
        <div class="reveal-content">
          <p>The Washington Post alone counted a staggering <strong>30,573</strong> false or misleading claims during his first term—that's approximately <strong>21 fibs per day</strong>, which rather puts one's occasional "I'll just have one biscuit" to shame.</p>

        <span class="reveal-trigger">Where might one find the complete catalogue?</span>
        <div class="reveal-content">
          <p>There are entire Wikipedia pages, congressional trackers, and news archives dedicated to these failures and controversies—enough reading material to last you through several British winters, numerous cups of tea, and possibly the collapse of the Commonwealth.</p>

      <p class="disclaimer-footer">We do apologize for the brevity. One can only document so much absurdity before requiring a proper cup of tea and a lie-down.</p>
