        <h2>üé© The Ringmaster's Game Plan</h2>
        <p>
            Every election is a big game. Every policy is a play call. In this league, we all want to see America win-no matter our jersey color. But to win championships, you need a smart playbook, a disciplined team, and a coach who knows when to stick to the plan and when to call an audible.
        </p>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            <strong>Text-to-Image Prompt:</strong> "Donald Trump as a circus ringmaster in a red coat and top hat, holding a playbook labeled 'Agenda 47.' The tent is bustling, but some acts are missing or off-script. The crowd is a mix of applause and confusion. Retro colors: gold, red, blue, cream. --v 6 --ar 16:9"

        <h3>üöß Act 1: The Border Blitz-But the Defense Breaks Down</h3>
        <div class="scoreboard">
            <strong>The Play:</strong> Trump called for a goal-line stand at the border-promising to ‚Äúseal the line‚Äù and keep the opposition out.<br>
            <strong>Upfront cost:</strong> $315B‚Äì$1T for construction, enforcement, and deportation drives.<br>
            <strong>Ongoing penalties:</strong> $40B‚Äì$54B a year to keep the defense on the field.<br>
            <strong>Flag on the play:</strong> Courts challenged the rules. Some plays were called back, and the defense is still scrambling.
        </div>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            "A circus fence that stops halfway across the ring. Clowns and animals wander through the gap. The ringmaster (Trump) looks frustrated. The crowd is a mix of applause and concern. Circus poster style, warm reds and golds. --v 6 --ar 16:9"
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
            A good defense needs more than a big wall-you need a game plan that stands up to review and keeps the whole team in position.
        </div>

    <section class="act">
        <h3>ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Act 2: The Tariff Tightrope-A Risky Gamble</h3>
        <div class="scoreboard">
            <strong>The Play:</strong> Trump tried to run up the score for American manufacturing with steep tariffs-hoping to bring jobs back home.<br>
            <strong>Short-term gain:</strong> $2.1T‚Äì$4.6T in new revenue.<br>
            <strong>Turnovers:</strong> Higher prices for families and farmers, $22K lifetime cost per household, and a -6% hit to GDP.<br>
            <strong>Opponent‚Äôs response:</strong> Other countries hit back with their own tariffs, hurting our exporters.
        </div>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            "A circus performer juggling balls labeled 'Jobs,' 'Tariffs,' and 'Prices.' One ball is dropped, rolling toward the crowd. The ringmaster looks on, concerned. Vintage circus poster style. --v 6 --ar 16:9"
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
            Sometimes, a risky blitz can backfire. When the offense and defense aren‚Äôt coordinated, the whole team pays the price.
        </div>

    <section class="act">
        <h3>üéüÔ∏è Act 3: The Executive Order Juggle-Too Many Trick Plays</h3>
        <div class="scoreboard">
            <strong>The Play:</strong> A flurry of executive orders-on elections, education, and more-tried to change the rules mid-game.<br>
            <strong>Setup cost:</strong> $10B‚Äì$20B for new systems and compliance.<br>
            <strong>Penalty yards:</strong> $5B‚Äì$10B a year in legal battles and court reversals.<br>
            <strong>Called back:</strong> Judges threw the red flag-many plays didn‚Äôt stand.
        </div>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            "A circus referee throws a giant red flag as the ringmaster (Trump) juggles scrolls labeled 'Orders.' The crowd reacts with surprise. Retro circus style, bold colors. --v 6 --ar 16:9"
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
            Even the flashiest playbook needs to follow the league‚Äôs rules. Trick plays can wow the crowd, but if they break the rules, they get called back.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="act">
        <h3>‚õΩ Act 4: The Energy Power Play-Short Gains, Long Losses</h3>
        <div class="scoreboard">
            <strong>The Play:</strong> ‚ÄúDrill, baby, drill!‚Äù Trump‚Äôs call for energy dominance aimed for a quick score.<br>
            <strong>Regulatory rollback:</strong> $180B in short-term savings.<br>
            <strong>Long-term injuries:</strong> $100B/year in health costs, higher household energy bills.<br>
            <strong>No touchdown:</strong> Global markets still set the price, and the scoreboard hasn‚Äôt moved much for families at the pump.
        </div>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            "A circus strongman tries to lift a giant gas pump labeled 'Prices.' The crowd watches, some cheering, some worried. Ringmaster looks on, pondering. Circus poster style, gold and red. --v 6 --ar 16:9"
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
            A power play needs to look beyond the next down. Quick gains can lead to long-term setbacks if you don‚Äôt protect your own end zone.
        </div>

    <section class="act">
        <h3>üåç Act 5: The World Stage Tightrope-Team USA Needs a Game Plan</h3>
        <div class="scoreboard">
            <strong>The Play:</strong> Standing tough against rivals like China and Iran-talking a big game on the world stage.<br>
            <strong>Cost of tough talk:</strong> $330B in lost exports from retaliatory tariffs.<br>
            <strong>Extra time:</strong> Military deployments and trade wars add $200B‚Äì$400B to annual deficits.<br>
            <strong>Need for teamwork:</strong> Solo acts don‚Äôt win championships-alliances matter.
        </div>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            "A circus tightrope act with the ringmaster (Trump) and assistants balancing on a rope above a globe. Some lose balance, the crowd gasps. Vintage circus poster style. --v 6 --ar 16:9"
        </div>
        <div class="takeaway">
            Winning on the world stage takes teamwork, not just highlight-reel moments. Championships are won with smart strategy, not just showmanship.
